# BigCommerce Webhook
This app was created using the [BigCommerce API Webhook tutorial](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/setting-up-webhooks), the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework, and the [Pug.js](https://pugjs.org/) template engine.
The app is designed to monitor a BigCommerce web store for changes through the API, and when it sees changes, output an HTML file displaying some information about the change.
**Note:** The node_modules directory has been excluded from this package since they come with the standard Express.js installation. This app will not work without those files, so you will be required to install Express.js first.
